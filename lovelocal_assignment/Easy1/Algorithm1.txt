Algorithm1

1)Start
2)Initialize a 'Scanner' object to read input from the user.
3)Prompt the user to enter a string.
4)Read the entered string using the 'nextLine' method of the 'Scanner' class.
5)Calculate Last Word Length:
	*Define a method called 'lengthOfLastWord' that takes a string 's' as a parameter.
	*Trim the input string 's' to remove leading and trailing spaces.
	*Find the index of the last space in the trimmed string using lastIndexOf(' ').
	*If no space is found (lastSpaceIndex is -1), return the length of the entire trimmed string.
	*Otherwise, return the length of the last word, which is the difference between the length of the trimmed 	string and the index of the last space.
6)Display Result:
	*Call the lengthOfLastWord method with the user-entered string.
	*Print the length of the last word.
7)End:
	*Close the Scanner to release resources
