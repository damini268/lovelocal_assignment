Algorithm3

1)Start:
2)Initialize a variable 'count' to 0.
3)Iterate through each number 'i' from 1 to 'n' (inclusive).
	*Call a helper function 'countOnesInNumber(i)' to count the number of digit 1 in the current number 'i'.
	*Add the result to the 'count' variable.
4)End:

5)Return the total count as the result.

The helper function 'countOnesInNumber(num)':

1)Initialize a variable 'count' to 0.
2)While 'num' is greater than 0:
	*If the last digit of 'num' is 1, increment the 'count'.
	*Divide 'num' by 10 to move to the next digit.
3)Return the final count.

This algorithm counts the digit 1 for each number in the range from 1 to n and accumulates the counts to find the total number of digit 1 in all these numbers.
